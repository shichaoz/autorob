<h3>Shichao Zeng</h3>
<h3>Instructor: Chad Jenkins</h3>







<br><h2>I. Motivation</h2>

<p>
    Autonomous robots, which is mostly about sensing, reasoning and acting, are playing an increasingly essential role in various fields. Sensing
    allows the robot to construct the maps of its surrounding. After getting the map, the robot can use the method of path planning
    to generate a path from the starting point to the goal without collision. In order to find the shortest path
    efficiently, several path planning algorithms are created, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search,
    A* shortest path algorithm and greedy-best-first search. Without generating the desired path, the robot is not able to 
    take action to move from the starting point to the goal.
</p>









<br><h2>II. Method</h2>

<p>
    The four path planing algorithms, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, A* shortest path algorithm and greedy-best-first search
    are most commonly used. In this report,we apply the four kinds of algorithms to different maps with various obstacles and compare the result with each other.
</p>

<h3>a) Depth-first search</h3>
<p>
    In the depth-first search algorithm, the element with the highest priority in the visit queue is the one 
most recently put into the visit queue. Therefore, the search will keep going in one direction, and change
direction when hitting the obstacle or collison while obeying the next one in the visit queue.
</p>

<h3>b) Breadth-first search</h3>
<p>
    In the breadth-first search algorithm, the element with the highest priority in the visit queue is the one most
    early put into the visit queue. Therefore, the search will keep increasing its search range equally in all
    direction.
</p>

<h3>c) A* shortest path algorithm</h3>
<p>
    In the A* algorithm, the element with the highest priority in the visit queue is the one with lowest f-score.
    F-score of a node equals the sum of the known shortest path from the node to the start and the line distance between
    the node and the goal. Therefore, the search will spread its search range faster in the direction towards the goal.
</p>

<h3>d) Greedy-best-first search</h3>
<p>
    In the greedy-best-first search, the element with the highest priority in the visit queue is the one with lowest
    h-score.
    H-score of a node equals to the line distance between the node and the goal.
    Therefore, the search will go directly towards the goal unless hitting the obstacles or collison.
</p>











    <br><h2>III. Results</h2>
<h3>a) Empty map</h3>
<p>
    The testing results of the four algorithms on the empty map with start
    [0,0] and goal [4,4] are shown in fig. 1. From table 1, Breadth-first, A* and greedy-best-first search have the
    same short path length, while depth-first search has much a longer path. The greedy-best-first takes the
    shortest time to find the goal, while the breadth-first search takes the longest time in searching. For the empty
    map, greedy-best-first is the best algorithm, as it is accurate and much faster than the others.

<h3>b) Misc map</h3>
<p>
    The testing results of the four algorithms on the misc map with start [0,0] and goal [4,4] are shown in fig. 2.
    From table 2, both breadth-first and A* have the shortest path, while depth-first has the longest.
    All of the four algorithms take a similar amount of time to find the goal.
    The greedy-best-first has the shortest time. Between breadth-first and A*, A* is faster.
    For the misc map, A* is the best, it finds the shortest path and is relatively fast.

<h3>c) Narrow 1 map</h3>
<p>
    The testing results of the four algorithms on the narrow 1 map with start
    [0,0] and goal [4,4] are shown in fig. 3. From table 3, breadth-first, A* and greedy-best-first have the shortest
    path. The greedy-best-first is the fastest one. Therefore, for the narrow 1 map, greedy-best-first is the best
    one.

<h3>d) Narrow 2 map</h3>
<p>
    The testing results of the four algorithms on the narrow 2 map with start
    [0,0] and goal [4,4] are shown in fig. 4. From table 4, breadth-first, A* and greedy-best-first find the shortest
    path. The greedy-best-first search have takes the least time. Therefore, for the narrow 2 map, greedy-best-first
    search is the best one.

<h3>e) Three sections map</h3>
<p>
    The testing results of the four algorithms on the three sections map with start
    [0,0] and goal [4,4] are shown in fig. 5. From table 5, breadth-first, A* and greedy-best-first find the shortest
    path. The greedy-best-first search have takes the least time. Therefore, for the narrow 2 map, greedy-best-first

    <br><h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    The advantages and the disadvantages of the four algorithms are obvious from the results.
    Firstly, the Depth-first search can hardly find the shortest path and almost search all the points on the map, which greatly depends on how the priority, often direction, is chosen.
    The A* algorithm improves the effiency because it gives a relatively reasonable priority to guide the search direction. Both A* and the breadth-first search can find the shortest path. Moreover, Greedy-best-first search is the one with the highest
    efficiency among A*, breadth-first, and greedy-best-first. However, it very depends on the what the map looks like. If there are obstacles cutting the line between tha start and the goal, greedy-best-first very likely can't find the shortest path. So basically the most practical method for path planning is A* algorithm.
